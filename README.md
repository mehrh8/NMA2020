This repo showcases my final project at NMA 2020.

## Uncertainty is reflected in animal's behavior
- **Hypothesis**: uncertainty in making a choice is reflected in the wheel turning speed.
- Absolute difference in stimulus contrast between the two sides was used as an uncertainty metric in the
decision task: the higher the difference between the stimuli contrast, the lower the uncertainty
- First, trials were divided into correct right, correct left, incorrect right, and incorrect left. Second, each
category was divided to two conditions including stimuli with 0 - 0.25 and 0 - 1 contrasts. Finally, the mean
(± standard error) wheel speed was computed by pooling all sessions and all trials for each condition. 
- Results:
  - 1 wheel speed was faster in correct trials compared to incorrect trials.
  - 2 wheel speed was faster in 0-1 contrast compared to 0-0.25 contrast.

## Uncertainty modifies brainwide neural responses
- Neural responses of diverse brain areas were investigated to find brain regions whose activity
is modified by uncertainty.
- Similar to behavioral study, trials were divided into 0 - 0.25 and 0 - 1 contrasts, representing
high and low uncertainty levels, respectively. To control for potential choice and outcome
effects, we used only correct left trials (ipsilateral to the recording sites).
- Mean (± standard error) of neural responses for the certain and uncertain conditions was
computed for all brain areas. A number of examples corresponding to visual, frontal, midbrain
and other areas are shown below:
